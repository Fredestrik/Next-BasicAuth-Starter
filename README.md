# Next BasicAuth Starter

---

üõ°Ô∏èThis is a starter app managing Basic authentification. The app is coded in Typescript within the Next.js framework. The CSS is managed with Bulma to have a simple yet nice interface. The user session is manage with the next-iron-session utility, which is designed specially for next.js. It is simple but secure.

_But Basic Authentification is not good for security ?_

Actually, if your application is serve with HTTPS, you have no reasons to have security concerns. Once the user is authentified, the connexion is secured with a next-iron cookie. Then, authentification of the user is super-fast and secure.

This application can be deployed on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme). It can also be deployed locally with `npm run build & npm start` command.
